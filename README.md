# XRR
Python code to read raw XRR data recorded at beamlines ID31 (ESRF), P08 (DESY, PETRA III), BL9 (DELTA) and evaluate data.<br>
You can also simulate XRR profiles and electron density profiles by providing a layer stack of your sample system.<br>
This code is developed and tested on Fedora Linux. 
## Requirements

## Installation
### Linux
`git clone https://github.com/Mike1712/XRR.git`<br>
`cd XRR`<br>
`pip install ./setup.py`
## Exemplary workflow with example data
There are a few jupyter notebooks to show how the scripts works:<br>
$\quad$ [Read raw data](src/XRR/notebooks/read_data.ipynb)<br>
$\quad$ [Simulation of layer stacks](src/XRR/notebooks/read_data.ipynb)<br>
$\quad$ [Plotting of evaluated data](src/XRR/notebooks/read_data.ipynb)<br>
